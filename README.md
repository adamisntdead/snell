[Snell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell's_law) is a formula used to describe the relationship
between the angles of incidence and refraction, when referring to light or other waves passing through a 
boundary between two different isotropic media.

## The Law

Snell's law states:

> The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction are equivalent to the ratio of
> phase velocities in the two media, or equivalent to the reciprocal of the ratio of the indices of refraction
